If you are familiar with Oracle's **HR** schema you may find the following useful.

I've written a script that generates a similar sample schema for **[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)** and **[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)**. The table structure and data remains the same.

The SQL script can be found **[here](https://github.com/nomemory/hr-schema-mysql)**
