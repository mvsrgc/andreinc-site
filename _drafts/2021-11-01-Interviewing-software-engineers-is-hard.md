Since 2014 or so, a sizeable proportion of my time at work was spent keeping technical interviews.

It's been quite a journey so far. Not only that I've had the chance to make most of the mistakes a technical interviewer can make, but I also managed to refine and improve my approaches. It also made me a better communicator, and as a side-effect, a better Software Engineer. 

But let me tell you, interviewing others (not only software engineers) is *hard* endeavor.

The first reason is the fact we have to deal with *hard* people. And without overgeneralizing, we programmers are not precisely the easy-going type. For example, the mainstream media loves to depict us as highly-introverted *nerds* lacking even the most basic interpersonal skills. That's not true at all. Some of the best communicators I've met were not the *obvious* pre-sales/client-facing types but brilliant engineers who could articulate, analyze and sell ideas naturally through their genuine way of being.

But, at the same time, the high global demand for (decent) Software Engineers made us a little spoiled and fueled abnormal ego growths; we've become *[blas√©](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blas%C3%A9)*, marked by complacency, and sometimes hard to deal with. After all, we are being paid high above the median rate; our LinkedIn inbox is full of *offers we cannot refuse* (that we frivolously ignore), so there's must be something *special* about ourselves?! It's easy to immerse ourselves into this mind trap. 

The second reason interviewing others is problematic is that this is a skill you can develop only by practicing it. Of course, you can read books, watch YouTube tutorials and participate in corporate training, but it's never enough. The only way you can master this craft is by doing it. So next time your manager asks you to participate in an interview, don't say you are very busy. You are being given free a chance to practice a skill that will make you a complete Software Engineer: the ability to evaluate others, and through a mirroring effect, yourself. 

# Know the industry

Nowadays, the world runs on software. 

In 2016, it was estimated that there were around [21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics) million professional developers in the world. By 2024, the number will probably grow close to 28.7 million. According to the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN) the global active labor force sits around 3.4 billion people. This means that less than 1% of the workforce is doing Software Development. 

In this regard, no matter where you are on the globe, finding talented developers is a hassle. At the same time, Universities are not pouring enough candidates into the market, and professional reconversion programs have "mixed" results. So the ability to attract, identify and keep talent is a crucial aspect that determines the success of a tech company in the medium to long run. We can say that it's not our job to attract and keep talent; that is why we have senior managers, marketing, talent, recruiting, or H.R. in place. But it's undoubtedly on our plate to identify and filter out our future colleagues.

So the first *axiom* on which I am basing this article is that good potential colleagues are hard to find.

Another observation is that a *bad hire* is more damaging for the wellbeing of a team than an unoccupied seat (at least in my experience). A *bad hire* is not necessarily a sub-mediocre, unreliable developer with an abrasive personality. In my opinion, a *bad hire* is also a person who is not a good cultural fit for the team (or company). For example, a *bad hire* might easily pass a hard technical interview, but in the medium run, his frustrations for not fitting in, will be a continual source of noise that will destabilize the team. 

You don't hire a PhD in Computer Vision to develop a Crud REST API for an e-commerce solution just because he knows python well. Of course, this an extreme example that might never happen in real-life. I am also not trying to say that the Computer Vision guy is a *superior* engineer and working on a webapp is beneath his dignity. What I am trying 

# Know your company and the role

Before participating in interviews, it's a good idea to understand the company culture and project you work for. If you've started interviewing in a company, and then moved to another, 

So asks yourself the following honest questions:

* Are you part of a *Product Company* or an *Outsourcing Company*? 
* Are the Software Engineers client facing or not? 
* Are you doing research work with limited interaction to the *outside world*?
* Is a strong Computer Science background important for the role? 
* Which is more important for the managers: *deadlines* or *quality control*?
* Is the project greenfield or it's in maintenance mode?
* Are you using the latest technology or your engineering managers follow a more conservative path?
* Are you working in a structured environment, or things are more chaotically?

The reason you need to ask yourself those questions is because there's no such thing as a *universally fit* candidate. 

# Show respect

## Negativity should be left aside

Before the interview, be professional and put every feeling of emotional negativity aside. You can be late with a deliverable, frustrated with your boss, hate the company, and plan to leave soon, or terrible things are happening in your personal life. 

Well, it's not the candidate's fault for any of it! In the same, it's also not your fault, we are humans and we have both good or bad days, but just be empathetic, and put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel if the person who interviews you for your dream job be a grumpy, passive-aggressive, distracted troll who shows zero interest in your professional persona?

If you think you cannot put the negativity aside, it's preferable to reschedule the interview altogether. Or better to ask a colleague you trust to replace you. Remember, suitable candidates are rare to find, and it would be a pity to lose them for reasons that could have been avoided from the beginning. 

## Do your homework

On the same note, the most basic form of courtesy you show to the candidate is to do your homework. Try spending at least 10 minutes before the interview reading the candidate's CV. I would recommend at least remembering their first name, knowing the most relevant companies they worked for, and the technology stack they have the most experience with. Bring this info up during the actual interview. Candidates will invariably appreciate the interest you've shown to their persona, and will open up more. 

When you are analyzing the CV, try to create a mental model about who the candidate is, without making fake projections. You still haven't met in person. Just because he started his career with PHP, and you don't like that language, doesn't mean he or she is not a good fit. 

If the candidate has an open-source portfolio, you can take another 10-30 minutes of your time trying to understand his interests or look at the code they wrote. 

At the exact opposite end of the spectrum, the worst thing you can do is to say "Hello, Mike!" to a candidate called Adrian and then start reading the CV in front of him. 

# Read between the lines

Most of the medium to big size companies nowadays are testing candidates from two perspectives, their technical proficiency plus their capacity to adapt to a new environment and work culture. So there's a split between the "hard" skills and the "soft skills'' sessions. 

This is usually a best practice, because the technological astuteness of an individual doesn't always compensate for a good teammate or a person you can further rely on. There are of course exceptions, when a company needs to hire a brilliant jerk to save a project, or to give him some research work. But this type of hiring is a "controlled event". Also, contrary to popular opinion, and in my experience, brilliant engineers are some of the most moderate and modest people you can have around.
