Following [**my previous article on this topic**](http://andreinc.net/2010/09/25/how-to-convert-a-picture-into-html-using-java/) I've created a (very simple) graphical user interface (Swing-based) for the classes presented there . Unfortunately (_don't ask me how_) the sources have been lost .Â The only thing remaining is the .jar (only .class files) .

In case you haven't read the initial article, the program will convert a picture (supported formats: JPG, PNG, BMP) into a HTML file .

The program can be download from **here** (to run the .jar you should have [JRE 1.6](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) installed on your computer).

The algorithm is described **[here](http://andreinc.net/2010/09/25/how-to-convert-a-picture-into-html-using-java/)** .
