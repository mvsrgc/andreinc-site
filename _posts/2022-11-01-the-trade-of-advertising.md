> "Advertisements are now so numerous that they are very negligently perused, and it is, therefore, become necessary to gain attention by magnificence of promises and by eloquence sometimes sublime and sometimes pathetic. Promise, large promise, is the soul of an advertisement. I remember a washball that had a quality truly wonderful—it gave an exquisite edge to the razor! ... **The trade of advertising is now so near to perfection that it is not easy to propose any improvement**." [Samuel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson), ["The Idler"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idler_(1758%E2%80%931760)) Jan. 20, 1758

The last phrase aged like milk. 

If Dr Johnson (link) only knew what advertising would become, how it would intertwine with psychology, arts, mathematics and engineering, and will forever change the face of the Internet in "unusual" ways. Who would've imagined twenty years ago that advertising companies would run the Internet through means and strategies that are not very obvious to the broader masses? Who cares what lies behind my search if I get the right results? Right?!

Let's ask one hundred strangers from the street what kind of company [Big Tech] is; most of them will probably tell you it's a tech company. That might be true, but what [Big Tech] sells (through others) is "Meta"-advertising tech services. The same goes for your favourite search engine or social media giant; you name them. Everything free comes with a hidden cost; in the new Internet, that cost is a "portion" of your freedom. It's the freedom to have thoughts, preferences, opinions, and questions that aren't stored in one paunchy [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake).

Most people do not care about this type of freedom; why would they? They imagine that everything they search, like and subscribe to remains suspended in the aether between them and the computer screen. After all, what is there to hide? The average person is not doing anything illegal on the Internet. The people who believe they have nothing to hide are the least concerned with privacy, and this could be a good stance if the companies recording your clicks are ethically using the data. However, what is ethical in profiling people without their (conscious) consent and then using this edge to manipulate their consumeristic behaviours?

Is advertising bad? Well, it is certainly not evil. Smaller entities would only have the chance to make it big with advertising. A colourful banner is at most benign. How can an independent newspaper sustain itself without advertising nowadays? It is a problem when advertising companies cross the boundaries of creating clever slogans and start using techniques that are closer to propaganda and brainwashing. As usual, things become suddenly dystopian when politics, mathematics and neuromarketing enter the picture. Neuromarketing is how companies get to your brain to make you buy their products. Mathematics is the tool they use to profile you and understand who you might be.

They don't care about your name, biography or CV; although they don't say no to them, there's enough data "in you" to understand what type of potential customer you are. That's enough information to be targeted by a marketing campaign. Yes, you are "a target". Nobody will kill you, god forbid, but the things you will see sporadically on your screen (or inbox) might turn the scale in their favour. If you were undecided before, a rightfully controlled strategy could make you take the jump willingly without even realising you were subtly manipulated. Contrary to popular belief, we are not exactly a purely rational specie, but we are probably the most rational species on Earth. That's reassuring?!

Think for a moment, how can a company that offers you everything for free makes a profit? After all, millions of people visiting their sites incur huge costs (computationally wise). CPUs are consuming electricity, and paying for electricity requires money. The minds behind their products (software developers, product owners, QA engineers, and the management apparatus) cost lots of money, sometimes more than keeping the infrastructure alive. How can those companies afford to pay the biggest salaries, on average, in the industry? It's simple, providing state-of-the-art tools for big companies to run efficient ad campaigns and get into the right minds. Whenever you search, like and subscribe to X, your data will be stored, processed and used to create an even better mathematical model of who "people" actually are and what they truly wish. You are constantly evolving their datasets. Realistic datasets lead to accurate business decisions. Mathematics and technology, in general, have evolved enough nowadays to make "pure" data the new gold. 

I don't want to sound alarmist, we have yet to reach a critical point of no return, but we are going in a direction where tech giants will know more about what you truly desire than you ever will. The foundation is already put in place. Without proper regulations, things can spiral out of control. Meanwhile, with every search, like and subscribe, society is feeding "the slumbering dragon" its favourite food: Data.

People need to be fully aware of the magnitude of the data-collecting phenomenon. My parent's generation (people in their 60s) is generally clueless regarding technology and the Internet (I know, I know, [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) is 69). On the other side of the spectrum, younger generations are so accustomed to social media networks they cannot imagine life without them. A few years ago, I remember being hooked to social media so much, that the first thing I was doing in the morning, instead of washing my face and brushing my teeth, was to check the notification bells to see what happened while I was asleep. Never again!

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2022-11-01-the-trade-of-advertising/mrrobot.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

And then some understand the risks, but many of those are willingly crippling their online experience with extreme measures, software and precautions. Alternatively, they became radicalized on privacy issues and wrote articles like *[How to destroy Google](https://freakspot.net/en/how-to-destroy-Google/)*, which is not constructive and highly toxic. This is not the fight from Mr. Robot. You see, Google (or Meta, or the others) are not evil personas that have minds of their own and want to bring havoc to the world. They are companies that want to operate on profit, and good people are hired to make this happen. Their field of activity is something new and unregulated. It is not their fault the regulatory mechanisms are not put in place. On a brighter note, both Google and Meta (under pressure), became much more transparent in recent years regarding their under-the-hood activities. GDPR was a promising start. However, more should be done! Until then, we must incorporate a few best practices and spend a few dollars a month to keep trackers at bay.

It's also worth mentioning that when we think of data collection, we imagine that Google, Meta, Twitter are the biggest culprits. That's not the case. People love to bash them. The 10 biggest online [data brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker) are: [Acxiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acxiom), [Clearview AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_AI), Epsilon, [Equifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax), [Experian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian), [PeekYou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeekYou), [Tapad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapad) (acquired by Experian), TowerData, [TransUnion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion), and ...Oracle. Many social media sites act like fishing nets and sensors to gather user/customer information, but the data goes further into the “system, " which is way more profound and has more significant implications.

So how do I protect myself from trackers without going paranoid about it? Remember, as an individual, you cannot fight [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch), but at least [don't feed it too much](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/child-sacrifice-is-an-ancient-and-shameful-tradition).

## 1. Use the right (set of) browser(s)

If a browser is [*non-free software*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html) or at least not open-source software, avoid it at all costs. A browser is important enough in your life that you want people to have access to its source code, for both security and privacy reasons! Chances are the average user will never look at how the browser is written, this doesn't mean expert eyes are not looking for unethical or error-prone code in existing open-source projects.

By far, today, the most popular browser on the Internet is Chrome. I mean, it is fast, it has a nice set of plugins, and coders love the Developer Tools. Why not? Because the dominant browser of this decade gives one company a vast amount of control of how the web works, and, as a bonus<sup>-1</sup>, it loves collecting your data.

> <sub>[It’s time to ditch Chrome](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-chrome-browser-data) (June 6, 2022)</sub>

But if you still love Chrome, and you want its best parts (the rendering engine and the plugins), try some "un-googled" alternatives: [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium), [bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) (Android), or even [Brave](https://brave.com/) (if you have a high tolerance towards cryto).

Just bare in mind, Chrome's Manifest V3 new rules are going to affect adblocking extensions.

> <sub>[AdGuard’s new ad blocker struggles with Google’s Manifest v3 rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adguard-s-new-ad-blocker-struggles-with-google-s-manifest-v3-rules/)</sub>

So maybe it's time to ditch Chrome, and pick a sane browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) or the more conservative, and privacy-aware [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/). 

Personally, I have two browsers installed on my machines (both mobile and desktop); one is Brave, and the other one is Firefox. I use Firefox for social media sites (it's the only browser where I am logged in LinkedIn, github, lobsters, hackernews, etc.). And then, I use Brave for normal browsing, reading news, work-related personal documentation, and all the other searches I do online etc. With a little bit of discipline, it shouldn't be hard to maintain this setup.

Brave has built-in ad-blocking capabilities, and Firefox has a few nice extensions that seem to work well on both mobile and desktop: [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), [AdGuard AdBlocker](https://adguard.com/), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/), [Privacy Possum](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-possum/), etc. In my tests, I also found out that Brave seems to be the winner when it comes to [browser fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint). 

## 2. Use alternative search engines

The first search engine that comes to mind with satisfactory results is [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/). When I've tried it, a few years ago, my searches yielded terrible results, but now I prefer to use it over anything else. I am not saying the people behind [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are angels... also the core of their product is [closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Source_code).

> <sub>[DuckDuckGo Isn’t as Private as You Think](https://www.wired.com/story/duckduckgo-microsoft-twitter-ft-bush-assassination-whatsapp/) (May 28, 2022)</sub>

In this regard I also have good experiences with [startpage](https://www.startpage.com/), [qwant](https://www.qwant.com/) and [search.brave](https://search.brave.com/). In my current setup, I am rotating between different search engines, but I still default to `duckduckgo` for my daily use (especially on mobile)... as I said, I am not going fully paranoid, and I still want to use the web as normal as possible.

If you are mostly reading about programming, you can also try [https://search.feep.dev/](https://search.feep.dev/).

## 3. On your phone, don't use the "app", use the mobile site instead

The rationale is simple. Most apps are closed source, and even if they are thin wrappers on top of the mobile site, God knows what hides between the lines (of code) that wrap the site, God, and the people that have access to the sources. Opening the mobile site through the browser (also) means protecting you against trackers and ads. Browsers like Firefox and Brave (at least on Android) offer you the option to "install" the mobile version as an "app". Some companies simply hate you when you do that.

This is how reddit is discouraging me from using their mobile site:

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2022-11-01-the-trade-of-advertising/reddit-mobile.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"} 

The first time you navigate to their site, they open a "modal" popup at the bottom of the screen informing you that *"This page looks better in the app"*. Also, notice the *"Use App"* button at the top of their screen. My suggestion to reddit is to make this (mobile) page look better than the app... it's not that hard, I mean [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) looks perfect on mobile, and it's not valued at billions of dollars.

LinkedIn has the same pattern, but it's even worse, the functionality is crippled on their mobile version. For example, once you write a comment to a post, there's no option to edit the message, you either have to open the desktop version or do it in the official app.

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2022-11-01-the-trade-of-advertising/linkedin-mobile.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"} 

And the list of entities and sites practising "anti-mobile" measures (for lack of a better term) is growing. If I am to give a price for the most toxic mobile site experience, the clear winner is Twitter. 

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2022-11-01-the-trade-of-advertising/twitter-mobile.jpeg){:height="25%" width="25%"} 

Why is *Twitter better on the app*? Well, let's read what [@stevekrenzel](https://twitter.com/stevekrenzel/) has to say about the most unethical thing he was asked to do while working at the Twitter App:

![jpg]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2022-11-01-the-trade-of-advertising/twitter-mobile2.png){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

The moral of the story ([full story here](https://twitter.com/stevekrenzel/status/1589700721121058817)) is the following:
* This level of [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) cannot happen by visiting a mobile site, but only by installing an app;
* The implementation didn't happen;
* The problem is not with Twitter itself, but with the lax regulations represented in ToS;
* What if the same feature is implemented in other popular apps, and we cannot possibly know because the apps themselves are closed-source, and there's no Steve Krenzel to tell the story? 

As an experiment, if you are on Android, I also suggest you install [PCAPdroid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.emanuelef.remote_capture/), and monitor how many of your apps are *calling home*, without apparent reasons. If you are on IOS... 

## 4. Change your email provider to an encrypted one

> <sub>[Google will no longer read your emails to tailor ads](https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/23/technology/business/google-ad-scanning-email-stop/index.html) (2017)</sub> 

> <sub>[Google adds opt-out for Gmail's 'smart features' to reassure regulators](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/17/google-adds-opt-out-for-gmails-smart-features-to-reassure-regulators) (2020)</sub>

There's a long history of (free email) providers scanning the content of your emails so they can better tailor ads for you. All the big players did it, or they are still doing it in some form or another. You probably have nothing to hide, but imagine having a neighbor reading your letters and correspondence and then gluing the envelopes back like it never happened. Would you feel comfortable meeting him a few days later and being asked: 

> *Hey neighbour, I understand you want to buy a new car! I've talked to my friends, and I have the perfect deal for you ... (bla bla bla)?* 

> *Hey neighbour, I understand you've bought tickers to Venice, wanna help you rent a car? Or a gondola?* 

> *Hey neighbour, I've seen your wife bought a bed for a newborn. I believe she's pregnant, here are some diapers discounts!?* 

Without making any publicity, there are a few companies on the market that offer you encrypted email offerings (for a few dollars a month). PCMAG.com made [a top](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-email-encryption-services) of the best. Without telling you which, I am already using some of the services listed there. Do your due diligence, and pick the one that suits you best, or if you are truly technical you can run your email server, problem solved!

## 5. To VPN or not to VPN

First of all, contrary to popular advice using [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) is overkill, unless you are living in a country with severe *Free Speech* issues, and you want to protect yourself from potential legal repercussions, or you are doing illegal things on the Internet, but that's your problem. Other than that, using TOR will make everything work slowly (try browsing with TOR and tell me it's a satisfactory user experience), or it will draw unnecessary attention to you if the country you are living in monitors Internet traffic.

Of course, TOR offers good anonymity, and it's the best solution on the market against fingerprinting, but I doubt you need it so much if you are the average person browsing programming blogs, commenting on hacker news and Reddit, reading newspapers and from time to time do some online shopping. For me, there are bigger disadvantages of using TOR than real, objective advantages. 

Second of all, do I recommend a VPN? Yes and No. Personally, I use one (I won't name it), because it blocks ads and trackers extremely well. So the reason I am using a VPN is not that I want to be anonymous online (that's an illusion), but because the provider I am using is offering an extra layer of protection against unwanted ads and data tracking. There's a reason some are actively fighting this amazing feature of modern VPNs:

> <sub>[Google Play will prevent VPN apps from interacting with and blocking ads](https://mezha.media/en/2022/08/31/google-play-will-prevent-vpn-apps-from-interacting-with-and-blocking-ads/) (August 31, 2022)</sub>

## 6. "To Android" or "to IOS"

This is a tough decision, and you have to pick your poison. Both operating systems require you to be logged in with an account so there's literally no escape from telemetry, apps abusing your trust and gathering private information that is associated with that account. Nowadays, a mobile phone is like Stalin's wet dream. So unless you want to try a [Pine Phone](https://www.pine64.org/), or a Custom Android ROM tailored for privacy, there's no escape for you.

On Android, I suggest you take a look at [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/) as alternatives to Google Play. 

There's also a nice app called [Exodus](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) that scans your phone for apps that are known to speak with trackers. The intention is very noble, unfortunately, only the popular apps are covered.

## 7. Change the way you surf the WEB

This is the essential aspect of them all. The way people are browsing the Internet is different than, let’s say, ten years ago. We’ve become complacent, and we accept content that is curated by algorithms and not by humans. Having an “infinite wall” of information at our disposal created by an algorithm became the new norm. In a way, people look at the Internet from guarded windows, be it Reddit, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. You see an interesting link, you click, and you don’t even look at the name of the site you’ve visited; you read or watch the content, and then you return to your guarded window, repeat. Depending on what you click, the algorithm behind the wall wants to give you similar content so you can stay longer. To make things spicier, maybe you will see some information that will trigger you; you know, there should be a rollercoaster of feelings to keep you hooked. Or perhaps you will see a little nudity to make your brain go, “wow, nice site!”.

Maybe it's time to give RSS Readers a chance, and start reading materials from independent sources. Choose an RSS Reader that's a standalone app, doesn't sync with a server and doesn't keep your data in the cloud. Create a personalized list of sites, blogs, and newspapers. It's simple, in this way you are controlling the content you fed to your brain, not a biased piece of software, *The Algorithm*. 

Personally, I use [Feeder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/) (really appreciate the fact they haven't called Feedr) and manually manage my OPLM file.
