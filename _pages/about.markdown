My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu; I live in Bucharest, ([Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl.

<sup><sup>Bucharest, Romania</sup></sup>

I have a *Bachelor's Degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology* from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009). 

I've started programming as a kid, in [BASIC], using some [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/):

I consider myself primarily a Java guy, but I have a soft spot for C and Kotlin. I can also *speak* python and start conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent). During my career, or as a student, I've flirted with Scala and rust, never got to the next level, so we've ended up "just friends". For more professional information, please check my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-n-ciobanu-50708611/).

I usually blog about Java, math, and Computer Science curricula. 

Other than programming, I am a chess enthusiast, I love to listen to and discover hidden musical gems.
