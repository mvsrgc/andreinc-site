My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu; I live in Bucharest, ([Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl.

<sup><sup>Bucharest, Romania</sup></sup>

I have a *Bachelor's Degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology* from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009). 

I've started programming as a kid, in BASIC, using some [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/):

I consider myself primarily a Java/Kotlin guy, but I have a soft spot for C.

I can also *speak* python and start conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent).  

I've flirted with Scala and rust, never got to the next level, so we've ended up "just friends". For more professional information, please check my .

I usually blog about Java/Kotlin, Math, and various topics related Computer Science curricula.
