My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu; I live in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl.

I've started programming as a kid, in BASIC. My first <sup>micro</sup>computer was one [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/). All the lucky romanian kids from 90s had them:

I consider myself primarily a Java/Kotlin guy, but I have a soft spot for C. I can also *speak* python and have basic conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent).

I keep my technical skills sharp by doing coding exercises and contributing to the open source world. My most *popular* project is [www.mockneat.com](http://www.mockneat.com). 

I usually blog about my interests: Java/Kotlin, Mathematics, Computer Science curricula (algorithms and data structures).
