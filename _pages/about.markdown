My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu; I live in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl.

I have a *Bachelor's Degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology* from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest (2009).

I've started programming as a kid, in BASIC. My first <sup>micro</sup>computer was one [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/). All the lucky romanian kids from 90s had them:

I consider myself primarily a Java/Kotlin guy, but I have a soft spot for C. I can also *speak* python and have basic conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent).

I keep my technical skills sharp by doing coding exercises and contributing to the open-source world. My most *popular* project is [www.mockneat.com](http://www.mockneat.com). 

I usually blog about my interests: [C]({{site.url}}/categories/#c)/[Java]({{site.url}}/categories/#java)/[Kotlin]({{site.url}}/categories/#kotlin), Mathematics, Computer Science curricula (algorithms and data structures).

The blog is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The comments system is based on [utterances](https://utteranc.es/).

I create the "visuals" with [draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/). For all the math formulas, I use [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
