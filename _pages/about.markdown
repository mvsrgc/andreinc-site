My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu, born in '87, and for the last 17 years, I've lived in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest) ([Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl. 

Online you might find me under the pseudonym of **nomemory**. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology from the University of Bucharest (2009). 

I've started programming as a kid, in [BASIC], using some [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/) (HC91 - a Romanian Microcomputer):

I consider myself primarily a Java guy, but I have a soft spot for C and Kotlin. I can also *speak* python and start conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent). During my career, or as a student, I've flirted with Scala and rust, never got to the next level, so we've ended up "just friends".

Thank you for stopping by!
