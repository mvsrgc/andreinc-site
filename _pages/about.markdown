My name is Andrei N. Ciobanu, born in '87, and for the last 17 years, I've lived in [Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest) ([Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)). I am happily married and the father of a sweet baby girl. 

Online you might find me under the pseudonym of **nomemory**. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology from the University of Bucharest (2009). 

I've started programming as a kid, in [BASIC], using some [of those](https://muzeuldecalculatoare.ro/2018/09/23/i-c-e-felix-hc-91/) (HC91 - a Romanian Microcomputer):

I consider myself primarily a Java guy, but I have a soft spot for C and Kotlin. I can also *speak* python and start conversations in C++ (although the natives accuse me of having a thick foreign accent). During my career, or as student, I've flirted with Scala and rust, never got to the next level, so we've ended up "just friends".

I prefer using Apple computers for programming, but in the past, I was an active member of the Ubuntu community. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ, and my favourite text editor is Visual Code, replacing Atom last year.

Most of my career was spent doing backend development with Spring. I am no stranger to databases (Oracle, MySql, MongoDb, Elasticsearch, etc.)
 
Other than programming, I tend to keep myself occupied with chess and music... and literature... and table tennis. 

My favorite Chess opening as White is Ruy Lopez, as as black is the French Opening or the Semi-slav. 

When it comes to music I keep an eye on the prog-rock scene, without being prog-rock snob (if that's even possible). If I am to believe Spotify those are most my listened artists:

I don't have a favorite book, but I do have some favorite writers: [Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert) and [Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem).

Other than Romanian, I can speak English and French (medium level).
Thank you for stopping by!
