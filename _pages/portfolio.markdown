This section contains links to my "open source" projects and libraries. 

### [MockNeat](https://www.mockneat.com/)

**mockneat** is an arbitrary data-generator open-source library written in Java. It provides a simple but powerful (fluent) API that enables developers to create `json`, `xml`, `csv` and `sql data` programatically. It can also act as a powerful Random substitute or a mocking library.

### [ServerNeat](https://github.com/nomemory/serverneat)

**serverneat** is ~~not another~~ a Kotlin Web Server for mocking and stubbing Rest APIs. It provides and easy to use DSL ([Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language?oldformat=true)) and seamless integration with [**mockneat**](https://www.mockneat.com/) for generating dynamic `json` responses. ServerNeat can be used as standalone application, capable of loading, compiling and evaluating kts scripts, or as a Kotlin/Java library.

### [MapNeat](https://github.com/nomemory/mapneat)

**mapneat** is a JVM library written in Kotlin that provides an easy to use DSL ([Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language?oldformat=true)) for transforming `json` to `json`, `xml` to `json`, `pojo` to `json` in a declarative way. No intermediary POJOs are needed. Given's Kotlin high-interoperability MapNeat can be used in a Java project without any particular hassle.

### [MarkovNeat](https://github.com/nomemory/markovneat)

**markovneat** is a Java [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain?oldformat=true) implementation.

### [AlephFormatter](https://github.com/nomemory/aleph-formatter)

**aleph-formatter** is a lightweight library for `String` formatting that supports both named and positional parameters with a twist: it has a limited support for object introspection. Aleph Formatter performs better than `String.format` for simple use-cases.
